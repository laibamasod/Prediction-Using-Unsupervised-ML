## Predicting the Optimum Number of Clusters and Visualizing Results in the Iris Dataset

### GRIPSEPTEMBER23

This repository contains the code and resources for completing Task 2 as part of the GRIP (Graduate Rotational Internship Program) for the September 2023 cohort.

## Overview

In this task, we use Python and Jupyter Notebook to predict the optimum number of clusters in the Iris dataset and visualize the results. This is a beginner-level task aimed at developing skills in data analysis and clustering.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is the "Iris" dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning and data science. The dataset is accessible via the following link: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Iq7YvbWZbt8VXjfm06brx66b10YiwK-/view)

## Methods Used

1. K-Means Clustering: We apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to the Iris dataset to group similar data points together.
2. Elbow Method: We utilize the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for the K-Means algorithm.

## Installation

You may need to install the following libraries to run the code:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip


## Usage

To execute the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Predicting_Optimum_Clusters_Iris.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, perform clustering, and visualize the results.

Feel free to experiment with different parameters or modify the code as needed.
